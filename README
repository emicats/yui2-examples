A collection of working examples using YUI 2.x.  Mostly specific to DataTable, Paginator, and Slider.  Generally, these were created in response to specific questions in the ydn-JavaScript user group (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/) or the yuilibrary.com forums (http://yuilibrary.com/forum/)

Examples span v2.5.0 thru the latest 2.x version.

Most of these are available live at http:yuiblog.com/sandbox/yui/v[version]/examples/[component]/
